    <h2><em>A Primer</em></h2>
    
        <p>The Gulf oil spill is recognized as one of the worst industrial disasters in history, and certainly as the worst oil spillin U.S. history. It began when, several days after the April 20, 2010 explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, underwater cameras found the BP pipe on the ocean floor was leaking oil and gas about 42 miles off the coast of Louisiana. By the time the well was capped, an estimated 3.19 million barrels of oil had leaked into the Gulf.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the explosion and subsequent discovery of the ruptured pipe, efforts were made by workers from BP and Transocean (who owned the Deepwater Horizon rig), along with many government agencies, to control the spread of the oil the ocean's surface, seafloor, beaches along the coast, and other ecosystems using by using chemical oil dispersants to break it down underwater.</p>
        <p>Over the course of 87 days, the damaged pipeline, located around 5,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface, leaked into the Gulf of Mexico. Once the oil had leaked out of the pipe, it began to spread throughout the a column of water above the leak. Some floated to the ocean's surface to form oil slicks, which can spread more quickly by being pushed by winds, while another portion bonded with chemicals in the seawater and sank to the seafloor, threatening the ecosystems there. </p>
        <p>By 2012, BP and the United States Department of Justice charged BP with 11 counts of manslaughter, two misdemeanors, and a felony count of lying to Congress. BP agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics, and the Environmental Protection Agency announced that BP would be temporarily banned from new contracts with the US government. BP and the Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $4.525 billion in fines and other payments. Steve O'Rourke, Justice Department attorney, noted that the penalty "has to be high enough that companies of this size won't let a spill like this ever happen again."</p>
